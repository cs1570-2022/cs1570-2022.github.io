\begin{problem}{1}
        In the ``$k$-Multiple Boolean Satisfiability Problem'' $kMSAT$, given a Boolean formula $\phi$ with $m$ variables and $n \geq m$ literals, we want to decide whether it has at least $k$ satisfying assignments, where $k=O(1)$. (I.e., at least $k$ distinct truth-value assignments to its variable for which $\phi$ is satisfied.) Prove that $kMSAT$ is NP-complete.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2}
    Let $BF_k$ denote the set of Boolean formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form such that each variable appears in at most $k$ places (i.e., in at most $k$ literals).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that the problem of deciding whether a Boolean Formula in $BF_2$ is satisfiable is in $P$.
    \item Show that the problem of deciding whether a Boolean Formula in $BF_3$ is satisfiable is $NP-Complete$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
